# PulseWatch

Aimed at the elderly and those with volatile ailments, **PulseWatch** is an Android companion for the Microsoft Band which keeps track of the Band wearer's heart rate, in real-time. If the wearer's heart rate falls outside of the user-defined bounds, the app immediately sends a text message to an emergency list of contacts (defined by the user). The message will include the wearer's name, their heart rate at that moment, and their precise geolocation, with a Google Maps link.
